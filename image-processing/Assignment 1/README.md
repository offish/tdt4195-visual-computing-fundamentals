## 1: Which of the following best describes the process of sampling?
- [ ] The process of amplifying a continuous signal.
- [x] The process of converting a continuous signal to a discrete one by reading values at a set time interval.
- [ ] The process of converting a discrete signal to a continuous one.
- [ ] The process of smoothing out a discrete signal.

## 2: What is quantization in the context of signal processing?
- [ ] The process of smoothing out a discrete signal.
- [ ] The process of amplifying a continuous signal
- [x] The process of converting continuous amplitudes from sampled values by rounding to one of the possible discrete values.
- [ ] The process of converting a continuous signal to a discrete one by reading values at a set time interval.

## 3: When looking at an image histogram, which characteristic indicates high contrast?
- [ ] The histogram has a bell-shaped curve, with most values clustered in the middle.
- [ ] The histogram is tall and narrow, with values concentrated around a single point.
- [ ] The histogram is evenly distributed across the entire intensity spectrum.
- [x] The histogram is spread out, utilizing a large portion of the intensity spectrum.

## 4: What is the effect of applying a log transform to an image with a large variance in pixel intensities on its dynamic range?
- [ ] The dynamic range increases significantly.
- [x] The dynamic range decreases.
- [ ] The dynamic range becomes unpredictable.
- [ ] The dynamic range remains approximately the same.
