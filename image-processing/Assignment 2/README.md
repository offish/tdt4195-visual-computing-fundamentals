## 9: What is the primary function of a high-pass filter?
- [ ] To convert a continuous signal into a discrete signal.
- [ ] To amplify low-frequency signals while attenuating high-frequency signals.
- [x] To block low-frequency signals and allow high-frequency signals to pass through.
- [ ] To equalize all frequencies in a signal.

## 10: The amplitude |F{g}| of the convolution kernel can be seen in the figure below. Figure out what kind of kernel it is (high- or low-pass).
- [x] High-pass
- [ ] Low-pass

## 11: The amplitude |F{g}| of the convolution kernel can be seen in the figure below. Figure out what kind of kernel it is (high- or low-pass).
- [ ] High-pass
- [x] Low-pass
